# Taha Majlesi

Hey there! 👋  
I’m Taha—a computer engineering student at the University of Tehran, always excited about AI, deep learning, and building things that make life smarter and more fun. I love helping others as a teaching assistant, and I’m happiest when I’m learning something new or hiking up a mountain.

If you share these interests or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out!
