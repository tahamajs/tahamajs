I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Tehran, with a deep interest in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and building intelligent systems. As a teaching assistant, I have contributed to multiple programming courses, and I am committed to advancing technology through curiosity, simplicity, and continuous learning. Outside of technology, I enjoy mountaineering and ecotourism.
